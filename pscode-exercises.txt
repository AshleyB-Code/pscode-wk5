// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

add together two numbers to get a total 
20
+
10
=
30

a = 20
b = 10

sum = 30


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
Set numbers as Even/Odd

request action (input a number) 
 IF   submission can be/2 = odd
 IF   submission can NOT be/2 = even
print results  
 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

Pick 5 random numbers 
  10, 15, 86, 40, 75
Find average = find the sum then / by total of numbers used 
A= sum/5
sum= 226 
A= 226/5 
A=45.2

Find minimum/Maximum number from number set 
compare values 
10<15, 10<86, 10<40, 10<75 
15>10, 15<86, 15<40, 15<75
86>10, 86>15, 86>40, 86>75
40>10, 40>15, 40<86, 40<75
75>10, 75>15, 75<86, 75>40

minimum= the lowest value of set= 10
maximum= the largest value in set = 86
